> *your career, your current.*

A mobile-first career coaching app. Not a job board. Not a resume builder. A smart, simple, and clean system for building the career that you want.

## What it is

Cove is a reflective onboarding experience that starts with *you* — where you actually sit as a person — then helps you understand what you're really chasing, and what's in the way.

Built on three ideas:
- **Go-Giver first** — show up with something to offer *(The Go-Giver, Bob Burg & John David Mann)*
- **Careers over cash** — the right fit pays you back in ways money can't count
- **Generous enthusiasm** — *"Do you always need a reason to help somebody?"* — Ash Ketchum

---

## Stack

- React 18, react-scripts 5.0.1
- Zero external libraries — inline styles throughout
- Hooks only: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`
- Mobile-first, max-width 480px
- localStorage for session persistence
- Discord webhook for reflection notifications

---

## Onboarding flow (10 steps)

1. **Welcome** — landing + tagline
2. **Privacy** — data commitments
3. **Philosophy** — three principles (Go-Giver, Careers over Cash, Generous Enthusiasm)
4. **Name** — what do people call you?
5. **Self Matrix** — plot yourself: Brave/Fearful × Curious/Judgmental
6. **Matrix Pause** — stop-and-go: task card, come back when done
7. **Pricing** — membership ($5/month trial)
8. **Brave Reflect** — what would a brave career decision look like?
9. **Fears Reflect** — what's in the way?
10. **Heart Pause** — terminal screen, reflections sent to Discord
